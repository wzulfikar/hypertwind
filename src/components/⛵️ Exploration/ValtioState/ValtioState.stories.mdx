# Valtio

A demo of using valtio in React. Goals:

- Show how to use valtio with some structure
  - States and "business" logic is encapsulated inside `state.ts`
  - There's a helper from `@/helper/resetState` to reset the state to its initial values
  - The `state.ts` also shows how to do async operation with valtio (ie. `fetchUser`)
  - Snapshot is exported as `useSnap` so the consumer doesn't need to be aware of valtio. Consumer only need to care about `import { state, useSnap } from "./state";`
- Show valtio's automatic render optimization
  - `ValtioState` doesn't re-render when `state.time` changes because it doesn't access `state.time` in its function body (it only accesses `state.count`)

## Demo

- Open browser console
- You'll see `[ValtioState] snap.count: 0`. This log is called inside `<ValtioState/>` component.
- Even though `state.time` changes every second, the `ValtioState` component doesn't re-render and thus, the log is static
- Click the "Increment" button below and you'll see this log added: `[ValtioState] snap.count: 1`
  - This happens because `<ValtioState/>` accesses the `state.count` in its function body, effectively telling valtio to subscribe to `state.count` and thus, triggering re-render when the `count` changes.

<ValtioState />
